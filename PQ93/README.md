## About PQ93

Quote from the official website: https://pennie.itch.io/pq93

```
PQ93 is a fantasy console written in modern C++ (previously in C). it uses Gameboy resolution (160x144), the arne16 color palette, and MoonScript. It runs on Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu.
```

## Noteworthy Notes

The PQ93 port was coded from scratch with moonscript (the coding language that PQ93 uses), having in mind the optimizations derived from the Pixel Vision 8 version. Like that version, this one also draws the cursor on screen as a sprite.
