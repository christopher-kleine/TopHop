## Noteworthy Notes

The code of this version was considerably optimized by the developer of Pixel Vision 8, and it served as the basis for the improved code of the newest LIKO-12 version update and some bugfixes from the previous versions. The latest updates of the versions for the other systems also have some improvements in the player animation.
