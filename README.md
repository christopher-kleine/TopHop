# Top Hop - A Tiny Challenge

Top Hop is a short puzzle-platformer game with only a few levels (which can be different in each version).

The protagonist of this game, Max, can't jump. So it's your task to attach technologically advanced springs to the ground.
Use your pointer, so he can reach higher platforms. But be aware! Max also can't swim, so avoid water.

However, there's a little problem: You only have 3 springs! Can you guide Max to the exit without him dying?

Try to beat this game's tiny levels!

## Gameplay

Max walks automatically, so the only thing you control is his jump, which is activated by springs that you have to attach to the ground with the cursor. If Max isn't going upwards, you can click on a spring you have already used and get it back.

## Controls

Press ![A-Button](images/button-a.png) to start/pause the game.

Use your mouse to place/remove springs.
